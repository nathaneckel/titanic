Were "women and children first"?  Watch my Tableau dashboard and related videos for my analysis.

You can see my Tableau dashboard below:
Tableau Dashboard is here: https://public.tableau.com/views/Cap1_Titanic_v07/AFTERTrip_1?:language=en&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link

Video1 is here: "TitanicAnalysis - Why Did So Many Swedes & Girls 5-9 Perish?"

Video2 is here: "Titanic Dataset - "Women & Children First?"
In this second of two videos I show you my analysis of the Titanic dataset in Tableau.  Why did so many european countries have such a low survival rate per the data? Also why might so many girls 5-9 years of age have died?  In this case the data is insufficient however I postulate a few reasons as to the potential causes.
This exercise was part of a course in Data Analytics that I enjoyed.
